3. Dump table into csv file "result.csv".

# Dump table into result.csv
with open('C:\\22bca75\\python\\result.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Student ID', 'Student Name', 'Subject 1',
    'Subject 2', 'Subject 3', 'Subject 4', 'Subject 5', 'Total Marks',
    'Grade'])
    writer.writerows(result_table)
    print(result_table)

4. Read result.csv file and Print Total Marks and Grade of each student. Also Append Total Marks and Grade column into result.csv file.

# Read result.csv and print total marks and grade
with open('C:\\22bca75\\python\\result.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip header row
    for row in reader:

        print(f"Student ID: {student_id}, Student Name:{student_name}, Total Marks: {total_marks}, Grade: {grade}")

5. List out Top 3 Student id and name with its percentage.

# List out top 3 students with percentage
sorted_results = sorted(result_table, key=lambda x: x[-2],
reverse=True)  # Sort by total marks
print("\nTop 3 Students:")
for i in range(3):
    student_id, student_name, *_, total_marks, grade = sorted_results[i]
    percentage = (int(total_marks) / 500) * 100
    print(f"Student ID: {student_id}, Student Name: {student_name}, Percentage: {percentage}%")
